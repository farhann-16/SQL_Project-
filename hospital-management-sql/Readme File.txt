# 🏥 Hospital Management System (SQL Project)

A comprehensive **SQL-based database system** designed to manage hospital operations, including patient registration, doctor scheduling, appointments, billing, and medical records.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
- Design and implement a **real-world hospital management database**.
- Showcase advanced **SQL concepts** like:
  - **Joins**
  - **Subqueries**
  - **Stored Procedures**
  - **Indexes**
  - **Transactions**
- Provide sample data and queries for analysis and reports.

## 📂 Database Schema Overview

### **Tables**
1. **Patients**
   - `patient_id` (PK)
   - `name`, `gender`, `dob`, `contact`, `address`

2. **Doctors**
   - `doctor_id` (PK)
   - `name`, `specialization`, `phone`, `availability`

3. **Appointments**
   - `appointment_id` (PK)
   - `patient_id` (FK)
   - `doctor_id` (FK)
   - `appointment_date`, `status`

4. **MedicalRecords**
   - `record_id` (PK)
   - `patient_id` (FK)
   - `diagnosis`, `prescription`, `visit_date`

5. **Billing**
   - `bill_id` (PK)
   - `patient_id` (FK)
   - `appointment_id` (FK)
   - `amount`, `payment_status`, `payment_date`

## 🔍 Sample Queries

### ✅ List all Appointments with Patient and Doctor Details
```sql
SELECT a.appointment_id, p.name AS patient_name, d.name AS doctor_name, a.appointment_date, a.status
FROM Appointments a
JOIN Patients p ON a.patient_id = p.patient_id
JOIN Doctors d ON a.doctor_id = d.doctor_id;
````

### ✅ Patients with Unpaid Bills

```sql
SELECT name FROM Patients
WHERE patient_id IN (SELECT patient_id FROM Billing WHERE payment_status = 'Unpaid');
```

### ✅ Total Revenue Per Doctor

```sql
SELECT d.name AS doctor_name, SUM(b.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM Billing b
JOIN Appointments a ON b.appointment_id = a.appointment_id
JOIN Doctors d ON a.doctor_id = d.doctor_id
GROUP BY d.name;
```

🔥 Do you want me to **also generate**:
✅ `schema.sql`  
✅ `data.sql`  
✅ `queries` folder (with `select_queries.sql`, `join_queries.sql`, `billing_procedure.sql`, `reports.sql`)  
✅ ER Diagram (as PNG)?  

So you can **zip it and upload directly to GitHub**?
